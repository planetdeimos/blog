<blockquote>
<p>And you may find yourself behind the wheel of a large automobile</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And you may find yourself in a beautiful house, with a beautiful wife</p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And you may ask yourself, Well, how did I get here?</p></blockquote>

<h3 id="origins">Origins</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve come to the belief that at some point in the &ldquo;Maker Development Life Cycle&rdquo; (think the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_process">SLDC</a> but for unserious or unprofessional projects) you reach a critical mass in which its now in your interest to publish a website/blog. Sure many try-hard students will throw together a website to show off their projects, codebase contributions, demos, etc during a job hunt. Completely understandable albeit unnecessary unless you&rsquo;re hunting for your first job out of university. This blog is being written from a point of self motivation to share knowledge.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something so frustrating and archaic about having to hunt and look for a solution to a random problem in forums. Just this week I had to chase down two different niche problems that were answered in a comment on a thread on a forum. While yes we all have had to spend our fair share of hours perusing stack exchange, github, and random websites across the internet seeking solutions for answers to our problems, I feel like a blogging format is much more optimized to quickly communicate and cut out all the unneeded garbage. It&rsquo;s practically a right of passage for any new developer, maker, sysadmin, devops, or architect to spend hours reading these types of sites for information or background. With AI on the rise, I feer that those days are rapidly coming to an end and rapidly are creating a new generation of professionals who seek out the easy answer using chatgpt over the long and laborious journey that we sometimes call research. A task that so many of us have a very fond love-hate relationship with.</p>
<p>Truthfully, I&rsquo;m not 100% certain where this blog will end up. Hell, like many of my projects, it make be left for dead, a wandering corpse taking up space on a hard drive in some random data center god knows where. But alas, like all things I think it&rsquo;s a good opportunity to try and grow both professionally (I&rsquo;m regrettably a github noob for someone who has a formal engineering background) as well as <a href="https://dhwblog.dukehealth.org/the-power-of-journaling-for-well-being-a-path-to-self-discovery-and-healing/">personally</a>. Only time will tell where this leads, but I hope that you&rsquo;ll consider joining me for this adventure nevertheless.</p>
