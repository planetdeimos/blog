Talking Heads said it best:

>And you may find yourself living in a shotgun shack

>And you may find yourself in another part of the world

>And you may find yourself behind the wheel of a large automobile

>And you may find yourself in a beautiful house, with a beautiful wife

>And you may ask yourself, Well, how did I get here?

### Origins

I've come to the belief that at some point in the "Maker Development Life Cycle" (think the [SLDC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_process) but for unserious or unprofessional projects) you reach a critical mass in which its now in your interest to publish a website/blog. Sure many try-hard students will throw together a website to show off their projects, codebase contributions, demos, etc during a job hunt. Completely understandable albeit unnecessary unless you're hunting for your first job out of university. This blog is being written from a point of self motivation to share knowledge. 

There's something so frustrating and archaic about having to hunt and look for a solution to a random problem in forums. Just this week I had to chase down two different niche problems that were answered in a comment on a thread on a forum. While yes we all have had to spend our fair share of hours perusing stack exchange, github, and random websites across the internet seeking solutions for answers to our problems, I feel like a blogging format is much more optimized to quickly communicate and cut out all the unneeded garbage. It's practically a right of passage for any new developer, maker, sysadmin, devops, or architect to spend hours reading these types of sites for information or background. With AI on the rise, I feer that those days are rapidly coming to an end and rapidly are creating a new generation of professionals who seek out the easy answer using chatgpt over the long and laborious journey that we sometimes call research. A task that so many of us have a very fond love-hate relationship with.

Truthfully, I'm not 100% certain where this blog will end up. Hell, like many of my projects, it make be left for dead, a wandering corpse taking up space on a hard drive in some random data center god knows where. But alas, like all things I think it's a good opportunity to try and grow both professionally (I'm regrettably a github noob for someone who has a formal engineering background) as well as [personally](https://dhwblog.dukehealth.org/the-power-of-journaling-for-well-being-a-path-to-self-discovery-and-healing/). Only time will tell where this leads, but I hope that you'll consider joining me for this adventure nevertheless.

 ad extremum.
