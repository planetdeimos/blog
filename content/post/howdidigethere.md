Talking Heads said it best:

>And you may find yourself living in a shotgun shack

>And you may find yourself in another part of the world

>And you may find yourself behind the wheel of a large automobile

>And you may find yourself in a beautiful house, with a beautiful wife

>And you may ask yourself, "Well, how did I get here?"

### Origins

I've come to the belief that at some point in the "Maker Development Life Cycle" (think SLDC but for unserious or unprofessional projects) you reach a critical mass in which its now in your interest to publish a website. Sure many try-hard students will throw together a website to show off projects, codebase, demos, etc during a job hunt. Completely understandable albeit unnecessary unless you're hunting for your first job out of university. This . This is from a point of self motivation to share knowlege. There's something about having to hunt and look for a solution to a problem in forums. While yes we all have had to spend our fair share of hours perusing stackexhange for answers to problems, I feel like a blogging format is much more optimized to quickly communicate and cut out all the unneeded garbage.
